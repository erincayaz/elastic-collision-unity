This code is not mine, I just took it from:
https://github.com/yoyoberenguer/Elastic-Collision/blob/version-1.0.2/ElasticCollision/Source/elastic_collision.c
and change it to make it usable on Unity. The reason I am uploading this to GitHub is just to eliminate the work
needed to be done to convert the above code to C#.
